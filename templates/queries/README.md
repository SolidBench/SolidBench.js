# Query templates

The `short` and `complex` queries within this directory are based on the [`interactive-` queries of SNB](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_interactive_impls/tree/c19be0e793680497de4e88d360a20708cfcf43a9/sparql/queries).
Queries are slightly modified to be based on IRI-based parameters instead of id/integer-based parameters,
as the former is better suitable for decentralized environments.
Non-SPARQL queries have been omitted.

Below, you can find an overview of these queries.
More details can be found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02299.pdf

`discover` queries have been created specifically for testing discovery-related choke points in data vaults.
